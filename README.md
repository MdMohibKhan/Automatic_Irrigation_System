# Automatic_Irrigation_System
Automatic Irrigation System (IOT based Application), This system  will ON/OFF the Motor pump automatically according to requirement  of water in the field.

This is a graphical user interface (GUI) based desktop application software which uses tkinter Module for the desktop graphics, SQLite for the back-end development. This application software manages all the records of the Irrigation system e.g.  records of the User, Sensor status,Motor pump status ,etc. 
			This application software presents an smart irrigation system for agriculture farm with the use of devices like Raspberry pi,Soil Moisture Sensor,Rain Drop Sensor,Motor Pump,5v Relay . Python programming language is used for automation purpose.  
      In this proposed system have presented the new innovative irrigation system. This system comprises the streaming of crops using this software and automatic motor on/off system, this systems make the irrigation fully automatic. The entire system is monitored and controlled by the power full credit card sized microcomputer called Raspberry Pi. Pi board is powered by Linux operating system.
